Dataset collection : 
Collect the dataset from the drive, link is provided below:

We have Used 5 models : 
* Model 1-CNN
* Model 2-Inception v3
* Model 3-ResNet50
* Model 4-VGG16
* Model 5-VGG19

we have trained,validated and tested for the dataset of kaggle provided above.

Then save the models as .h5 files.

To make use of this project for users, we have made an UI(User Interface).
Codes and Interface can be accesed in below link:

You can upload an chest xray image and select the appropriate model , and submit it. You can get the results and compare with other models.
